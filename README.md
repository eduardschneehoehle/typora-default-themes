# Typora Themes
Fork from Typora default themes

## Nightowl
Adapted from Github Dark 

I was looking for a theme that allowed me to easily distinguish between chapters, while being easy to read.
The existing ones not fully satisfy me, so here is my Dungeon Mastering-compatible theme.

* Monospaced font
* Dark colors, easy on the eyes

### Installation
Place within main Typora folder `...\Typora\themes\`
